### README.md for Project 0x00. C - Hello, World

This repository contains solutions to various tasks related to foundational concepts in the C programming language. Each script or program addresses specific learning objectives, from basic compilation to more advanced concepts like generating assembly code.

#### Project Overview
- **Weight:** 1
- **Duration:** Dec 14, 2023 6:00 AM to Dec 15, 2023 6:00 AM
- **Auto QA Review:** Scheduled at deadline

#### Auto QA Review Summary
- **Mandatory Tasks:** 0.0/41
- **Optional Tasks:** 0.0/12
- **Overall Completion:** 0.0%
- **Mandatory Completion:** 0.0%
- **Optional Completion:** 0.0%

#### Concepts Covered
- C Programming Basics
- Preprocessor Directives
- Compilation Process
- Assembly Code Generation
- Standard I/O Functions (`puts`, `printf`)
- Memory Allocation (`sizeof` operator)
- Error Handling and Return Values

#### Resources Used
- Relevant PDFs and online resources on C programming
- Works of Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds
- Betty Coding Style for code formatting

#### Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain the advantages of C programming
- Identify key figures in C's development
- Understand the compilation process (`gcc`, entry point, `main` function)
- Utilize standard I/O functions (`printf`, `puts`, `putchar`)
- Compile code with specified options (`-Wall`, `-Werror`, etc.)
- Apply the Betty coding style to ensure code quality
- Determine appropriate header files for standard library functions

#### Requirements
- **Editors Allowed:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **OS for Compilation:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Compilation Options:** `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Script Requirements:** Follow specific guidelines for scripts

#### Directory Structure
- **0x00-hello_world/**
  - `0-preprocessor`: Script to run C file through the preprocessor
  - `1-compiler`: Script to compile C file without linking
  - `2-assembler`: Script to generate assembly code from C file
  - `3-name`: Script to compile C file and create executable `cisfun`
  - `4-puts.c`: C program using `puts` function to print text
  - `5-printf.c`: C program using `printf` function to print formatted text
  - `6-size.c`: C program to print sizes of various data types
  - `100-intel`: Script to generate Intel-syntax assembly code from C file
  - `101-quote.c`: C program to print specific text to standard error without `printf` or `puts`

#### Notes
- All scripts and programs adhere to the requirements and constraints specified.
- Each task contributes to achieving the defined learning objectives.

#### Conclusion
This project aims to build a strong foundation in C programming, covering essential topics from basic compilation to understanding low-level operations like assembly code generation. By completing these tasks, you'll gain practical experience and knowledge necessary for more advanced C programming challenges.
