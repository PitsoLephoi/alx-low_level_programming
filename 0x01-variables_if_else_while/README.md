# ALX Low Level Programming - Curriculum

This repository contains projects and tasks designed to teach foundational concepts in programming, specifically focusing on the C programming language. Each project is structured to build understanding progressively, ensuring mastery of essential skills through practical coding exercises.

## SE Foundations

### Average: 2.01%
**0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while**

- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Dates:** Dec 15, 2023 6:00 AM to Dec 16, 2023 6:00 AM

### Overview
This project introduces fundamental concepts in C programming, including variables, conditional statements (`if` and `else`), and loops (`while`). It is designed to reinforce understanding through practical implementation and aims to prepare learners for more complex tasks in subsequent projects.

### Auto QA Review
- **Auto QA review:** 0.0/70 mandatory & 0.0/21 optional
- **Altogether:** 0.0%
- **Mandatory:** 0.0%
- **Optional:** 0.0%
- **Calculation:** 0.0% + (0.0% * 0.0%) == 0.0%

### Concepts
For this project, emphasis is placed on the following:
- Usage of basic C concepts: variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops.
- Practical application with real-world examples.
- Encouragement to utilize Docker & WSL for a conducive programming environment setup.

### Resources
- **Read or watch:** "Everything you need to know to start with C.pdf"
  - Focus on slides such as: comments, data types (integer types), declarations, arithmetic operators, variables assignments, comparisons, logical operators, if statements, if...else statements, while loops.
- **Keywords and identifiers:** integers, arithmetic operators in C, if statements in C, relational operators, logical operators, while loop in C, ASCII character set.
- **Additional resources:** Introduction to C (Basic structure and variables).

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, learners are expected to:
- Explain fundamental C programming concepts without external assistance.
- Demonstrate proficiency in:
  - Arithmetic, logical, and relational operators.
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `if...else`).
  - Variable declaration and assignment.
  - Basic usage of `while` loops.
  - Understanding of ASCII character set and compiler flags (`-m32` and `-m64`).

### Copyright - Plagiarism
Plagiarism is strictly prohibited. All solutions must be independently crafted to fulfill learning objectives. Any form of academic dishonesty will result in removal from the program.

### Requirements
- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **File standards:** All files should end with a newline.
- **Documentation:** Each project should include a `README.md` at the root folder.
- **Style guide:** Code should adhere to the Betty style and will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.

### Quiz Questions
- The project concludes with a quiz to evaluate understanding and retention of covered topics.

## Projects and Tasks
The repository includes multiple tasks designed to reinforce learning objectives progressively:
- **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
- **1. The last digit**
- **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
- **3. alphABET**
- **4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
- **5. Numbers**
- **6. Numberz**
- **7. Smile in the mirror**
- **8. Hexadecimal**
- **9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
- **10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
- **11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...**
- **12. Software is eating the World**

Each task builds upon the previous one, providing incremental challenges to enhance skills in programming logic and syntax.
